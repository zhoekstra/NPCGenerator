The NPC Generator consists of a Generator that reads a few different types of
files. If you want to add to or modify the files it uses, I've included
instructions on how to do so here.

If you're having trouble figuring out the format, look at a few examples
I've included. Unfortunatly, right now the Generator is very picky about
the format it uses, so try to adhere as much as possible to the format laid 
out below.

First Name Files:
	First name files are located in Data/name/first. They contain a series
	of names, each one on a single line, in the format:

	<Name>\t<Gender>\n

	Name can be anything that does not contain a tab. Gender is one of the
	strings (m,f,mf,fm), denoting what gender(s) the name can be.
	
	The name of a first name file should be the ethnicity of the names
	included in it, in the format

	<Ethnicity>.txt

	Ethnicity names should NOT contain spaces of any kind.

Last Name Files
	Last names files are located in Data/name/last. They should share a
	filename with a first name file located in Data/name/first.

	These files consist of a series of last names, one on each line,
	In the format
	
	<Name>\n

	When the generator chooses an ethnicity for the character, it first
	picks a name from the first name file of that ethnicity, then a
	last name from the last name file of that ethnicity, then 
	appends them together. It is possible for an ethnicity
	to have a first name file, but not a last name file,
	in which case the last name is omitted. However,
	an ethnicity MUST have a first name file.

Trait Files

	Trait files are located in Data/trait. They contain a series of
	strings followed by integers, in the format:

	<Trait String>\t<Probability>\n

	Traits can also be followed by nothing, in which case their
	probability defaults to one. for example,

	<String>\n

	is equivalent to
	
	<String> \t 1 \n

	When the generator picks a trait from a trait file, it generates a
	random number between 0 and the sum of the traits probabilities.
	
	The number after a trait represents the probability that it will be
	selected. For example, if a trait file looks like this:

	A	100
	B	100
	C	50
	D	50

	A and B would have a 1/3 chance of being selected each, while C and D
	would have a 1/6 chance of being selected.

World Files
	
	Every time you run NPC generator, you must first select a World file to
	use. A world file is in the format,

	<Ethnicitys>
	TRAITS:
	<Traits>

	The ethnicities represent all the ethnicitis that exist in this world,
	in the format

	<Ethnicity>\t<Probability>\n

	After the words TRAITS: on a single line, list all the trait files
	that this world uses, without the .txt extension. The Generator will
	load these files in the order you give them in the world file.
