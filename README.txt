The NPCGenerator is a program designed to allow GM's to generate random NPC's
on the fly, while being as minimal and customizable as possible. While it is
currently in a buggy initial state,  it may eventually be improved.

When the NPCGenerator runs, it first asks for a valid .world file. When you select
one (I've included Deadlands.world, my current world file as an example),
it will bring up the generator. The upper left contains all of the traits. You can
set the traits by typing/selecting the trait you want and clicking the checkbox to the
right of the trait, "locking" it.

Once an NPC is generated, you can write notes about the NPC in the empty space to the right.

Click save to save the NPC's traits and it's notes to the table underneath. You can edit fields
in that table at anty time.

When you quit the generator, it will ask you for a place to save the characters you've generated.
It will save them as a CSV file, openable by Excel.

=== CURRENT SMART GENERATION ===
If you lock in a specific gender, the generator will generate a character of that gender

If you lock in a specific ethnicity, the generator will generate a character of that ethnicity.
